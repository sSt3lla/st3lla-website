Steps I made for this website to exist
- Creating it
- Registering it
- Using cloudflare to host

# Creating it
I feel like most people want to create a website from the ground up (hosting, programming etc), but I just wanted content on the web so I choose [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the theme of [miniamlise](https://github.com/g-hw/hugo-theme-nostyleplease)

I choose hugo because a friend was using this for their blog and recommended it to me. Everything is basically just markdown and .toml which means I can avoid CSS which is nice :)


# Registering it
For finding the cheapest domain possible I went with [Z.com](https://z.com/), no other reason

# Hosting
Cloudflare has a really nice [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything/) on hosting static pages, and also includes automatic deployment from a git [repo](https://github.com/sSt3lla/st3lla-website), which makes uploading extremely simple
